# Residual Networks

** In this assignment, you will:
- Implement the basic building blocks of ResNets.
- Put together these building blocks to implement and train a state-of-the-art neural network for image classification

This assignment will be done in Keras.

## The identity block

### Four Steps:

First component of main path:
- The first CONV2D has $F_1$ filters of shape(1,1)
